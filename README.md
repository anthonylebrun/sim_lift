# SimLift

This is an early prototype of an elevator challenge that we might use to evaluate potential candidates at On-Site.

## IDEAS

- Include bad data in CSV so that developers have to implement error handling in the dispatcher.
- Have different levels of assignments for junior/intermediate/senior devs with different requirements. Include different test suites for each of these levels. E.g. for junior: they only have to instantiate 1 elevator.
- Include tests for the dispatcher so that they can have a spec to write the actual dispatcher against.
