IDEAS

- Include bad data in CSV so that developers have to implement error handling in the dispatcher.
- Have different levels of assignments for junior/intermediate/senior devs with different requirements. Included different test suites for each of these levels. E.g. for junior: they only have to instanciate 1 elevator.
- Include tests for the dispatcher so that they can have a spec to write the actual dispatcher against.
- Give this test to engineers internally to see what they think and how they do.
- Bonus points for refactoring any code in the exercise itself. But don't modify any functionality.
